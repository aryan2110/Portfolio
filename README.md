<h1 align="center"> Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
<br/>

A personal website is something I really wanted to build‚Äînot just to showcase the projects I've worked on, but also as a space that reflects my learning journey and who I am. It's simple, responsive, and sprinkled with a few personal touches, like custom icons and playful tooltips.
